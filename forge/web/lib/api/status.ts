/**
 * Centralized status tone mapping.

 *  - components/admin/AdminOperations, AdminMigrations
 *  - app/server/[id]/database, etc.

 *  - forge/web/app/admin/source-deployments (pending/queued/cloning/building/pushing/deploying/healthy/completed/failed/canceled/unhealthy)
 *  - forge/web/app/admin/compose (running/deploying/awaiting_health/stopped/degraded/failed/updating/deleting/deleted) — 9 states inventoried
 *  - forge/web/components/server/builds-view (pending/running/succeeded/failed/canceled)
 *  - forge/web/components/server/deployments-view (pending/building/deploying/health_checking/live/rolled_back/failed)
 *
 * Consolidation per Phase 03 + Phase 06 (Deploy/Git beautify) finding: single statusTone + single deploymentStatusTone, eliminate per-file drift.
