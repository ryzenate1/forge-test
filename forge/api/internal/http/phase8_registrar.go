// Phase registrar priorities are spaced so a phase can be slotted between two

// are arbitrary but their relative order is what Fiber uses to resolve
// overlapping paths, so they are left alone.

// RegisterPhase8 registers the branding upload/serve surface, which has no

//
// It used to also register /forgefile/*, /onboarding/* and /ide/files. Those
// paths belong to registerForgefileRoutes (handlers_forgefile.go) and
// registerPhase8OnboardingRoutes (phase8_onboarding.go), both of which run
// before this registrar — every register*Routes call happens first, and among
// registrars the onboarding one has the lower priority number — so Fiber
// resolved all of those paths to the other registration and these copies never
// answered a request. They also carried weaker gating: the forgefile copies
// had no requireRole at all, and the manifest read was additionally exposed
// unauthenticated on v1 as /public/forgefile/:slug, leaking a project's deploy
// configuration and environment list to anyone who could guess a slug. The
// duplicates are gone and the two behaviours worth keeping (raw-YAML bodies,
// GET-form validate) now live on the routes that actually serve.
