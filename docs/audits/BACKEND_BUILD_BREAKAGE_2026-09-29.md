# Backend build breakage — `mvp-4` @ `bce7085`

**Date:** 2026-09-29
**Branch:** `mvp-4` (HEAD `bce7085`, working tree clean)
**Severity:** Blocker — neither Go module compiles
**Scope:** `forge/api`, `beacon`. Frontend not implicated.
**Status:** Corrected and partly remediated — read §8 before relying on §1.

---

## 1. Summary

Both Go modules on `mvp-4` fail to compile. This is committed breakage, not
uncommitted work-in-progress: the tree is clean and `HEAD` itself is broken.

```
cd forge/api && go build ./...   → exit 1 (5 errors reported, 3 packages reached)
cd beacon    && go build ./...   → exit 1 (1 error,  1 package)
```

Those five are what the compiler *reports*, which is not the blast radius. `go
build` abandons a package whose dependencies failed to type-check, so while
`crossnode`, `scheduler` and `placement` were broken, `internal/http` was never
examined — and it holds three further errors of its own, from the same commit.
The true API figure is **8 errors across 4 packages**; see the addendum (§8),
which supersedes the counts in this section.

Consequently `make build`, `make test`, `make api-test` and `make beacon-test`
are all blocked, and CI on this branch cannot be green.

Every API error and the one Beacon error trace to the **last two commits**,
both of which are bulk working-tree snapshots:

| Commit | Date | Subject |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `7389900` | 2026-09-27 | chore: commit working tree on mvp-4 |
| `bce7085` | 2026-09-27 | chore: commit working tree follow-ups on mvp-4 |

Neither was compiled before being committed. Each carried a legitimate,
well-motivated hardening change that was applied to *some* call sites and not
others.

---

## 2. Reproduction

The Go build cache must be redirected, because the agent sandbox denies writes
to `~/Library/Caches/go-build`:

```bash
export GOCACHE="$TMPDIR/go-build" GOTMPDIR="$TMPDIR"; mkdir -p "$GOCACHE"
cd forge/api && go build ./...
cd ../../beacon && go build ./...
```

> **Note on a misleading first read.** Without the `GOCACHE` override, the build
> emits ~20 `open /Users/muni/Library/Caches/go-build/...` errors that bury the
> real diagnostics. Those are sandbox artifacts, not code defects. The same
> applies to `open /Users/muni/go/pkg/mod/cache/download/...` errors under
> `go vet ./...` — the module cache needs a write lock. Neither masks nor causes
> the defects below; both must be filtered out before reading build output.

---

## 3. Defects

### D1 — `crossnode`: deleted helper, orphaned call sites

**Location:** `forge/api/internal/services/crossnode/ingress_sync.go:170,171`
**Error:** `undefined: itoa`
**Introduced:** `7389900`

```go
ID:   primary.ID   + "-replica-" + itoa(i),
Name: primary.Name + "-replica-" + itoa(i),
```

Commit `7389900` deliberately removed the package-local hand-rolled
`func itoa(n int) string` from `health_filter.go` and switched that file to
`strconv.Itoa`. The replacement is explicitly justified in the code:

> `// every int: strconv.Itoa is used precisely because a hand-rolled formatter that …`
> — `health_filter.go:69`

The two call sites in `ingress_sync.go` — same package, and the helper's only
other consumers — were not converted, so they lost their only definition.

**Fix:** add `"strconv"` to the `ingress_sync.go` import block and replace both
`itoa(i)` with `strconv.Itoa(i)`. This completes the migration `7389900`
intended; do not reintroduce the hand-rolled helper.

---

### D2 — `scheduler`: value→pointer migration missed one backend

**Location:** `forge/api/internal/scheduler/scheduler_nomad.go:310`
**Error:** `cannot use totalMem (variable of type int64) as *int64 value in struct literal`
**Introduced:** `7389900`

Commit `7389900` converted the shared `scheduler.ResourceUsage` from value
fields to pointer fields — an "unknown is not zero" hardening that matches the
project rule in `AGENTS.md`:

```go
// before 7389900                  // after 7389900 (scheduler.go:87)
type ResourceUsage struct {        type ResourceUsage struct {
    CPUPercent float64                 CPUPercent *float64 `json:"cpuPercent,omitempty"`
    MemoryMB   int64                   CPUMHz     *int64   `json:"cpuMHz,omitempty"`
    DiskMB     int64                   MemoryMB   *int64   `json:"memoryMb,omitempty"`
}                                      DiskMB     *int64   `json:"diskMb,omitempty"`
                                   }
```

`scheduler_k3s.go` was migrated correctly and is the reference implementation —
it takes addresses and documents why one field stays `nil`:

```go
// DiskMB stays nil: metrics-server does not report filesystem usage, and
// "not reported" must not be encoded as zero.
return ResourceUsage{CPUPercent: &cpuPercent, MemoryMB: &memMB}, nil
```

`scheduler_nomad.go` was left on the old value form.

**Fix:** mirror the k3s pattern — `return ResourceUsage{MemoryMB: &totalMem, CPUMHz: &totalCPU}, nil`.
See **L1** below: the CPU half of this is a live semantic bug, and this is the
right moment to close it.

---

### D3 — `placement`: refactor applied to caller, not callee

**Location:** `forge/api/internal/placement/replica.go:187`
**Error:** `not enough arguments in call to e.placeSingleReplica`
**Introduced:** `bce7085`

`bce7085` introduced a request-scoped working set — `replicaPlacementState`
(bundling `candidates` + `usedNodeCount`), `prepareReplicaPlacement()` and
`state.apply()` — and rewrote `PlaceReplicas` to pass it:

```go
// replica.go:187 — new 4-arg call
placement, err := e.placeSingleReplica(ctx, state, replica, req)

// replica.go:209 — callee still on the old 5-arg signature
func (e *Engine) placeSingleReplica(ctx context.Context, candidates []Candidate,
    replica ReplicaSpec, req ReplicaPlacementRequest, usedNodeCount map[string]int) (*ReplicaPlacement, error)
```

Before `bce7085` both sides agreed at five arguments
(`e.placeSingleReplica(ctx, workingCandidates, replica, req, usedNodeCount)`).

**Fix:** migrate the callee to `(ctx, state *replicaPlacementState, replica, req)`
and read `state.candidates` / `state.usedNodeCount` internally. `placeSingleReplica`
passes both through to `scoreReplicaCandidate`, which also takes
`usedNodeCount map[string]int` — decide whether that helper takes `state` too, or
keeps the map parameter. Note `ExplainReplicaPlacement` builds its own
`usedNodeCount` map independently (`replica.go:360`); if it is meant to stay in
step with the decision path, it should be moved onto `prepareReplicaPlacement`
as well, or it will drift from the engine it claims to explain.

---

### D4 — `placement`: unused import

**Location:** `forge/api/internal/placement/replica.go:9`
**Error:** `"gamepanel/forge/internal/runtime" imported and not used`
**Introduced:** `7389900`

`7389900` *added* this import already-unused — the import is absent at
`7389900^`, and no version of the file has ever contained a qualified
`runtime.` reference. It is stray debris from the bulk snapshot, not the
residue of a removed use.

**Fix:** drop the import. No restored use is needed.

---

### D5 — `beacon`: `context.AfterFunc` given a channel

**Location:** `beacon/internal/remote/reconnect.go:252`
**Error:** `cannot use rc.stopCh (variable of type chan struct{}) as context.Context value`
**Introduced:** `bce7085` (new code — `probeContext` did not exist at `bce7085^`)

```go
// probeContext bounds a round-trip by the parent context, the probe timeout and
// Stop(), so no probe can outlive shutdown.
func (rc *ReconnectClient) probeContext(ctx context.Context, timeout time.Duration) (context.Context, context.CancelFunc) {
    probeCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, timeout)
    watchStop := context.AfterFunc(rc.stopCh, cancel)   // ← stopCh is chan struct{}
    return probeCtx, func() { watchStop(); cancel() }
}
```

`context.AfterFunc` takes a `context.Context`. `ReconnectClient` has no context
for shutdown — it signals stop by closing `stopCh chan struct{}`
(`reconnect.go:61`, closed in `Stop()` at `:308`).

This is brand-new code that has never compiled, so the stated guarantee — "no
probe can outlive shutdown" — is currently unproven in either direction.

**Fix, two options:**

1. **Keep the channel.** Replace `AfterFunc` with an explicit watcher:

   ```go
   done := make(chan struct{})
   go func() {
       select {
       case <-rc.stopCh: cancel()
       case <-done:
       }
   }()
   return probeCtx, func() { close(done); cancel() }
   ```

   Consistent with the rest of the file, which already selects on `stopCh`
   (`:160`, `waitOrCancelled` at `:294`).

2. **Add a stop context.** Give `ReconnectClient` a `stopCtx`/`stopCancel` pair
   alongside `stopCh`, cancel it in `Stop()`, and pass `rc.stopCtx` to
   `AfterFunc`. Cleaner long-term, but touches the lifecycle of a struct with
   `startOnce`/`stopOnce`/`stopped`/`started` plumbing — more care needed.

Option 1 is the smaller, lower-risk change and matches existing idiom.

---

## 4. Latent issues masked by the compile failure

These are not compile errors. They are in the same code paths and will ship
silently the moment the build is fixed, so they should be resolved together.

### L1 — Nomad reads CPU, then discards it

**Location:** `forge/api/internal/scheduler/scheduler_nomad.go:302-311`

```go
var totalMem, totalCPU int64
for _, tg := range job.TaskGroups {
    for _, t := range tg.Tasks {
        totalMem += t.Resources.MemoryMB
        totalCPU += t.Resources.CPU      // accumulated…
    }
}
return ResourceUsage{
    MemoryMB: totalMem,                  // …never returned
}, nil
```

`totalCPU` is summed and dropped. This predates the pointer migration (it dates
to `7835806`, 2026-07-21, when the file was created), but the migration changes
its meaning and makes it worse: under pointer semantics a `nil` `CPUMHz` means
*"not reported"*, so Nomad now actively asserts it has no CPU reading for a
value it successfully parsed. That is precisely the failure mode `AGENTS.md`
prohibits — *"not-reported is not zero"*, and a reading that was taken must not
be reported as absent.

Fixing D2 by setting `MemoryMB: &totalMem` alone would compile while leaving
this in place. Set both.

### L2 — `ReplicaPlacement.Reserved` has no producer

**Location:** `forge/api/internal/placement/replica.go:59-65`

The field was added in `bce7085` with an unusually strong contract:

> `// Reserved is the capacity this replica occupies on NodeID from the moment`
> `// the engine chose it. The engine holds nothing across requests, so the`
> `// caller must make this amount durable … before another placement reads the`
> `// same node's free capacity; reporting a placement nobody reserved would be`
> `// reporting work that was not performed.`

Nothing assigns it. Both `return &ReplicaPlacement{...}` sites in
`placeSingleReplica` (`:229`, `:268`) omit `Reserved`, no other file in
`internal/placement`, `internal/http` or `internal/services` writes it, and no
test references it.

Every placement therefore reports `Reserved: {CPU:0, MemoryMB:0, DiskMB:0}`. A
caller that follows the documented contract and reserves the reported amount
reserves **nothing**, then the next placement reads stale free capacity and
over-commits the node — the exact outcome the comment warns about. The
serialized field (`json:"reserved"`) exposes the same zeros over the API.

The spec for this is already in the file (`ReplicaSpec` carries
`CPU`/`MemoryMB`/`DiskMB`, and `state.apply()` at `:157` already debits exactly
those three values), so populating it during D3's rewrite is a small change.

### L3 — `gofmt` drift (the nit is small; the remedy is not)

`forge/api/internal/placement/replica.go:16` — `RequiredNode string` is not
column-aligned with its neighbours in the struct. `internal/http/realtime.go`
and `internal/http/server.go` carry the same drift, outside the lines the fixes
touched. Flagged only so it is not mistaken for a manual edit later, and
deliberately kept out of the build-fix commits: reformatting untouched lines
would have buried the actual repairs in noise.

**`make format` is not a three-file fix.** Measured on this branch, `gofmt -l -s`
reports **124 files in `forge/api` and 2 in `beacon`**, and
`scripts/dev/format.sh` additionally runs `prettier --write` across all of
`forge/web` and `packages/*`. The remedy for a three-file alignment nit is
therefore a 126-file Go rewrite plus a frontend rewrite of unknown size.

What that sweep actually contains, measured rather than assumed:

- **`-s` is a no-op on this branch.** `gofmt -d .` and `gofmt -d -s .` produce
  byte-identical output in *both* modules. So the equal file counts do not mean
  "every simplifiable file also has whitespace drift" — they mean **no file has
  a simplification opportunity at all**. Nothing semantic moves. (Equal *counts*
  cannot distinguish those two cases, since a file with both kinds of drift
  appears once in each list either way. Only diffing the content settles it.)
- **The sweep is 226 hunks in two whitespace categories**, not one: column
  alignment inside `const`, `var` and struct blocks, **and 26 files missing a
  trailing newline** (all in `forge/api`, e.g. `cmd/api/river.go`). 223 hunks
  across 124 files in `forge/api`, 3 across 2 in `beacon`. Run `gofmt -d` from
  inside each module to reproduce those figures — from the repo root the diff
  headers carry the module prefix and the byte totals differ.
- `goimports` is not installed here, so `format.sh` takes its fallback branch
  and will not reorder imports either.
- The prettier half could not be sized: `prettier` is absent from local
  `node_modules` and `registry.npmjs.org` is denied by the sandbox proxy.
  Unsized is the honest entry; do not substitute a guess.

So the reason to hold is **not** that the sweep is risky in itself — on this
branch it is mechanically inert. It is that a 126-file rewrite lands on top of
whatever other sessions are holding uncommitted in the same checkout. This is a
whole-branch formatting decision wanting its own commit, taken when nothing is
in flight.

None of the fixes in §8.3 introduced any of this drift.
`scheduler_nomad.go` and `ingress_sync.go` are `gofmt`-clean;
`reconnect.go`'s drift is the `const` block at lines 18–23, which `29d1600`
never touched (it came in with `7389900`, which added those constants).

---

## 5. Root cause

Two consecutive bulk snapshot commits — `7389900` and `bce7085`, both titled
"chore: commit working tree …" — were committed without a compile.

The changes they carry are not sloppy in intent. Every one is a defensible
hardening, and most serve rules stated in `AGENTS.md`:

- delete a hand-rolled int formatter in favour of `strconv.Itoa` (D1)
- make "unknown" representable rather than encoding it as zero (D2)
- give replica placement a single request-scoped working set so an explanation
  cannot describe a winner the engine would not pick (D3)
- bound a Beacon probe so it cannot outlive shutdown (D5)
- validate the WebSocket `Origin` header against the allow-list (D6)
- thread the ACME service explicitly instead of reaching for an ambient one (D7)
- let host resolution **fail** rather than return a bare string (D8) — this is
  "never report success for work not performed" applied exactly as written

The failure is uniformly one of **incomplete application**: each migration
updated part of its blast radius. D1 and D2 converted one file and missed a
sibling in the same package; D3, D7 and D8 changed a signature and left a call
site behind; D5 and D6 wrote new code against an API whose signature was never
checked. A single `go build ./...` in either module would have caught all nine.

**Process gap:** `go build ./...` on both modules is not currently enforced
before commit on this branch. Given `go.work` spans both modules, one
`go build ./...` per module is sufficient and fast.

Note also that the sandbox's `GOCACHE` denial (§2) makes a naive `go build`
output look like ~20 unrelated filesystem errors. Anyone who ran a build here
without the `GOCACHE` override would plausibly have dismissed it as a local
environment problem rather than a code failure. Worth adding the override to
the dev docs.

---

## 6. Recommended remediation order

Smallest and most certain first; each step is independently verifiable.

| # | Defect | Change | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | D1 | `strconv.Itoa` + import in `ingress_sync.go` | trivial |
| 2 | D2 + L1 | `&totalMem` **and** `&totalCPU` in nomad `GetResources` | trivial |
| 3 | D5 | channel watcher in `probeContext` (option 1) | low |
| 4 | D4 | drop unused import, or restore its use with step 5 | trivial |
| 5 | D3 + L2 | migrate `placeSingleReplica` to `*replicaPlacementState`; populate `Reserved`; decide on `scoreReplicaCandidate` and `ExplainReplicaPlacement` | moderate — only judgement call in the set |

Then:

```bash
export GOCACHE="$TMPDIR/go-build" GOTMPDIR="$TMPDIR"
cd forge/api && go build ./... && cd ../../beacon && go build ./...
make format
make test        # first full-suite signal since 7389900
```

`make test` has not been able to run since `7389900`, so expect its first green
run to surface further drift — in particular, `AGENTS.md` notes that
`go vet ./...` in `forge/api` already reports failures in test files referencing
symbols production code no longer exports. Triage that separately from this
breakage; the two are not the same problem.

---

## 7. Verification performed

- `go build ./...` on both modules, with `GOCACHE` redirected — exit 1 each.
- `go vet ./...` on both modules — same four defect classes, no additional
  production-code errors beyond D1–D5. **This was a ceiling on what the
  toolchain could see, not a clean bill of health.** `vet` type-checks per
  package and skips any package whose dependencies fail, so `internal/http`
  went unexamined here for the same reason `go build` skipped it (§8). Neither
  command can report the size of a cascade while the cascade is still in place.
- `git log -L` line-blame on each failing line to attribute the introducing commit.
- `git show <commit>^:<path>` on each file to confirm the pre-change state
  compiled, establishing all five as regressions rather than pre-existing breakage.
- `git show 7389900 -- health_filter.go` to confirm the `itoa` helper deletion
  and its intent.
- Grepped `internal/placement`, `internal/http`, `internal/services` and the
  package tests for `Reserved` writers — none found (L2).
- Base branch `mvp-3` could **not** be build-verified: a temporary worktree
  requires a writable Go module cache (`~/go/pkg/mod`), which the sandbox denies.
  Attribution above rests on line-blame and pre-commit file state instead, which
  is decisive for all five defects. A `mvp-3` build outside the sandbox would
  confirm the branch-level claim directly.

---

## 8. Addendum — corrections and remediation status

*Added 2026-09-29, after remediation began. §§1–7 are the original analysis;
where this section contradicts them, this section is correct.*

### 8.1 The error count in §1 understated the breakage

§1 quoted "5 errors, 3 packages" for `forge/api`. That was the compiler's
output, and the compiler could not see further: both `go build` and `go vet`
skip a package whose dependencies fail to type-check. `internal/http` imports
`internal/services/crossnode`, `internal/scheduler` **and**
`internal/placement` — all three broken — so it was never examined. It
type-checked for the first time only after D1–D4 were fixed, and produced three
more errors immediately.

| Module | Packages broken | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `forge/api` | 4 | 8 |
| `beacon` | 1 | 1 |
| **Total** | **5** | **9** |

The general lesson: **a reported compile-error count is a lower bound, not a
measurement, until the build is green.** An audit that quotes one should say so
rather than presenting it as scope.

### 8.2 D6–D8 — `internal/http`, hidden behind the cascade

All three are `7389900` regressions, attributed exactly as D1–D5 were —
`git log -L` on the signature line plus `git show 7389900^:<path>` for the
pre-change shape. None is pre-existing breakage.

**D6 — `realtime.go`: `Get` called on a WebSocket connection.**
`*fiberws.Conn` has no `Get` method. `7389900` added WebSocket origin
validation; at `7389900^` the file read no `Origin` header off the connection at
all, so this is new code written against the wrong accessor — the same failure
mode as D5. Fix: `client.Headers("Origin")`.

**D7 — `server.go`: call site left at the previous arity.** `7389900` gave
`registerCertificateRoutesExt` a third parameter, `svc *acme.Service`, and did
not update its single call. Fix: pass `cfg.AcmeService`.

**D8 — `handlers_crossnode.go`: single-value assignment from a two-value call.**
`7389900` changed `(*Resolver).ResolveTargetHost` from returning `string` to
returning `(string, error)` and left `host := resolver.ResolveTargetHost(…)`
in place. This is the most consequential of the three, because the signature
change *is* the `AGENTS.md` rule that resolution must be able to fail rather
than hand back a bare host — and this handler is the caller that has to act on
it. Silencing the error with `_` would compile and defeat the change; the error
must be propagated.

### 8.3 Remediation status

| Defect | Fix | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | `strconv.Itoa` + import in `ingress_sync.go` | committed `29d1600` |
| D2 + L1 | `&totalMem` **and** `&totalCPU` in nomad `GetResources` | committed `29d1600` |
| D5 | explicit stop-watch goroutine in `probeContext` | committed `29d1600` |
| D3 + L2 | `placeSingleReplica` on `*replicaPlacementState`; `Reserved` populated | committed `b7df85e` |
| D4 | unused `internal/runtime` import dropped | committed `b7df85e` |
| D6 | `client.Headers("Origin")` | committed `b7df85e` |
| D7 | `cfg.AcmeService` threaded to the registrar | committed `b7df85e` |
| D8 | `ResolveTargetHost` returns 404 `ErrNoTarget` / 502, never a guessed host | committed `b7df85e` |
| L3 | `gofmt` drift in `replica.go`, `realtime.go`, `server.go` | open by decision — `make format` is a 126-file sweep, see L3 |

The work was split across two commits because it was authored concurrently by
two sessions sharing this checkout. Both used path-scoped commits, so neither
captured the other's in-progress index:

- `29d1600` — D1, D2+L1, D5. Makes **`beacon` build clean on its own**; does not
  make `forge/api` build.
- `b7df85e` — D3+L2, D4, D6, D7, D8. Completes `forge/api`.

Worth recording about D8, because it is the substantive design decision in the
set: the pre-`7389900` call site would have wanted a fallback host. The fix
returns 404 (`ErrNoTarget`) or 502 instead, and never guesses — the same
reasoning as D2's `CPUMHz`, and what `AGENTS.md` means by "never resolve an
ambiguous target silently."

**Current state, both commits in:**

```
cd forge/api && go build ./...   → exit 0
cd beacon    && go build ./...   → exit 0
```

`forge/web` is also clean: `tsc --noEmit` and `eslint` pass, 572 vitest tests
passing.

`make test` still has no clean signal for the Go side on this branch. Two
sandbox limits block it here, and **neither is a code defect** — do not file
either as one:

- `httptest` cannot bind a listener (`listen tcp6 [::1]:0: bind: operation not
  permitted`), which fails `crossnode/TestGatewayReloadFailure` and
  `beacon/internal/remote/TestClientRejectsNon2xxResponses`.
- Any suite needing `stretchr/testify` or `lib/pq` cannot build its test
  binary: both have only `.mod` metadata in the local module cache, and both
  remedies are denied (module-cache writes, and `proxy.golang.org`). This takes
  out `internal/placement`, `internal/http`, `internal/eventstore` and
  `internal/store`.

Of what could run, `crossnode` passed 14 of 15. A full `make test` outside the
sandbox is still the first real post-`7389900` signal, and §6's warning stands:
expect further drift.

Two pre-existing web test failures are also open, unrelated to this breakage and
outside its scope: a relative WebSocket URL in `api.contract.test.ts`, and the
`GenerationFencedDots` ring in `design-system.test.tsx`.

---

*§§1–7 were analysis only, written against a clean tree. §8 records the
corrections found during remediation and the commit state as of writing. The
temporary worktree used for the `mvp-3` attempt was removed.*
